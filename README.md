Python scripts to load available Hg observation network data into a dataframe and output as a csv file. For most networks, these are outputted as daily means. Several EMEP sites have coarser time resolution for some of the measurement stations, so several options of time resolutions for outputted mean data are provided. This includes:

-CAPMoN (Canada): CAPMoN_network.py
Data can be accessed at: https://donnees.ec.gc.ca/data/air/monitor/monitoring-of-atmospheric-gases/total-gaseous-mercury-tgm/?lang=en

-AMNet (USA): AMNet_network.py
Data can be accessed at: https://nadp.slh.wisc.edu/networks/atmospheric-mercury-network/

-EMEP (Europe/Antarctica): EMEP_network.py
Data can be accessed at: https://ebas.nilu.no/data-access/

-GMOS (Global): GMOS_network.py
Data can be accessed at (currently under maintenance): https://sdi.iia.cnr.it/gos4mcat/srv/eng/catalog.search

-MOEJ (Japan): MOEJ_network.py
Data can be requested from the Ministry of the Environment Japan (MOEJ). For publication, see:  https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos10070362

-FMI (Finland) network: Finland_network.py
These data are submitted to EMEP, but an updated version was provided by Katriina Kyll√∂nen.

-miscellaneous data: other_sites.py
These data sets were provided by other sources, not directly from the networks
